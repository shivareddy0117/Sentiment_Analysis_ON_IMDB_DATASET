Here's an outline of a complete project in computer science that utilizes AWS SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service, to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model. In this example, we'll create a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews using the IMDb dataset.

Set up your environment:

Sign up for an AWS account if you don't have one.
Create an IAM user with access to Amazon SageMaker and Amazon S3.
Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your IAM user credentials.
Prepare the dataset:

Download the IMDb dataset: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
Preprocess the data by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and creating a bag-of-words representation.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Upload the preprocessed data to an S3 bucket.
Create a Jupyter Notebook in SageMaker:

Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon SageMaker.
Create a new notebook instance with the desired instance type, IAM role, and other settings.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and create a new notebook.
Load and preprocess the data in the notebook:

Import the necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, etc.).
Load the preprocessed data from the S3 bucket.
Perform any additional preprocessing steps as needed.
Train the machine learning model:

Choose a suitable algorithm for sentiment analysis, such as XGBoost or a neural network.
Configure the SageMaker training job with the algorithm, instance type, input data channels, and hyperparameters.
Launch the training job and monitor its progress in the notebook.
Evaluate the model:

Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint.
Use the SageMaker endpoint to make predictions on the testing set.
Calculate the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Clean up resources:

Delete the SageMaker endpoint to stop incurring charges.
Delete any S3 buckets and objects created for the project.
Stop and delete the SageMaker notebook instance if it's no longer needed.
This is a high-level overview of a sentiment analysis project using AWS SageMaker. You can find more detailed tutorials and examples in the AWS SageMaker documentation and SageMaker example notebooks.
